# SBM

These files belong the SBM project of Roeling and Nicholls and are used for the simulation study.

The R script reads in the edgelist [simulationdata_edges_r.csv] and generates two files: 

1. simulation_postprob.csv = the file with the posterior probability to belong to a class for every node. Note that there is an extra variable called labels, with the original labels, just for convenience, this is not normally generated by R but can be created by merging the output with the node label file [simulation_nodelist_R.csv]. I have already merged it on the fly just for your convenience. 

2. SBMsimulation = the complete SBM output from the blockmodels package. Even without the raw data this can be read in R with the readRDS("SBMsimulation") function (R script line 27). So you can check the raw output.


simulationdata_edges_r.csv (edge file), simulation_nodelist_R.csv (node file), and simulation_postprob.csv (node file) can be read in by Gephi (graph software) to visualize the network. All variable names are already prepared for easy read-in (but you can also download the simulation5.gephi file to get my settings and network configuration). The .png files are the plots generated by Gephi for the raw labels and class membership models.
